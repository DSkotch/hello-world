# hello-world
Cowabunga dude, so let's get it on
Reptiles against the fathers of the renaissance
We got the classical technique to kick these three toed freaks right under the street
I take a turtle and I turn him into mincemeat
You don't really wanna step to Da Vinci
I like the ladies, I like to keep it mellow
So lemme pass the mic to my man Donatello
